# Buttercup Field
Supports an online "festival" including video chat rooms and event announcements.

_(Named after our favourite juggling festival which is held in a buttercup field.)_

Requires: a webserver, PHP, MySQL (or similar), use of a third-party video conferencing system (currently [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)).

Users of the site require a web browser that supports Jitsi, or the Jitsi mobile app.  JavaScript is beneficial but probably not required.
